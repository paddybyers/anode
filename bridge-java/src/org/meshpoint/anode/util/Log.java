/**
 * Platform-independent logger, inspired by Android
 */

/**
 * API for sending log output.
 *
 * <p>Generally, use the Log.v() Log.d() Log.i() Log.w() and Log.e()
 * methods.
 *
 * <p>The order in terms of verbosity, from least to most is
 * ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, VERBOSE.  Verbose should never be compiled
 * into an application except during development.  Debug logs are compiled
 * in but stripped at runtime.  Error, warning and info logs are always kept.
 *
 * <p><b>Tip:</b> A good convention is to declare a <code>TAG</code> constant
 * in your class:
 *
 * <pre>private static final String TAG = "MyActivity";</pre>
 *
 * and use that in subsequent calls to the log methods.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><b>Tip:</b> Don't forget that when you make a call like
 * <pre>Log.v(TAG, "index=" + i);</pre>
 * that when you're building the string to pass into Log.d, the compiler uses a
 * StringBuilder and at least three allocations occur: the StringBuilder
 * itself, the buffer, and the String object.  Realistically, there is also
 * another buffer allocation and copy, and even more pressure on the gc.
 * That means that if your log message is filtered out, you might be doing
 * significant work and incurring significant overhead.
